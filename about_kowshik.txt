### **The Story of Peddireddy Kowshik Kumar Reddy**

Hello, my name is Peddireddy Kowshik Kumar Reddy. I was born on July 18, 2004, in a small village called North Rajupalem, located in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. My village is a peaceful place, and I grew up surrounded by nature and simplicity, which shaped who I am today. My family means everything to me. My father, Peddireddy Ravi, works as a policeman. His job is challenging and requires a lot of courage and dedication. I have always admired his commitment to his work and the way he takes care of our family. My mother is a homemaker, and she is the heart of our home. She takes care of all of us with so much love and care. I also have a younger sister who is currently studying in the 10th grade. She is hardworking and ambitious, just like me. We also have a pet dog, Lucy, a female Labrador who brings joy to our family with her playful and loving nature.

Currently, I am living in Chennai, which is a big, bustling city compared to my hometown. I moved here to pursue my studies, and I am now in the final year of my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R&D Institute of Science and Technology. My journey in education has been very rewarding. I have always been passionate about learning, especially when it comes to technology. Over the years, I have worked very hard in my studies, and I have achieved a CGPA of 9.5 out of 10. This academic achievement is a reflection of my dedication and commitment to excellence.

My interest in technology started at a young age. I was always curious about how computers work and how software is developed. This curiosity led me to start learning Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. I began by learning the core concepts of Java, such as variables, data types, loops, and functions. As I progressed, I delved deeper into object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a way of writing software that models real-world entities as objects with attributes and behaviors. I found OOP particularly fascinating because it allows for more organized and reusable code. Eventually, I also learned JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition), which is used for building large-scale applications, especially for businesses.

During my time at university, I applied my Java skills in various projects. One of the most significant projects I worked on was a secure web-based banking system. This project was designed to allow users to manage their bank accounts online, perform transactions, and monitor their account activity. It also included an administrative section where bank administrators could manage user accounts, view transaction histories, and perform other administrative tasks. The project was built using JSP (JavaServer Pages), Servlets, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and Tomcat9. These technologies helped create a robust and secure system that could handle multiple users simultaneously.

Another important project I developed was an employee time tracker. This system was designed to help employees keep track of their work tasks and time, while also providing managers with tools to monitor and manage their team's productivity. The system allowed employees to log in, view their tasks, add new tasks, and modify existing ones. It also provided dynamic visualizations of their work through pie charts and bar charts, making it easier to understand their progress. For the administrators, the system offered oversight of all employee tasks, ensuring efficient management of the team. This project also used JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and Tomcat9.

While Java has been my primary focus, I have also developed a deep interest in machine learning, a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data and make decisions. To gain practical experience in this field, I took up a Data Science Internship at Tonik Financial India Private Limited, a leading financial technology company, from May 13, 2024, to July 12, 2024. This internship was an eye-opening experience for me. I worked on several advanced projects that expanded my knowledge and skills in machine learning.

One of the key projects I worked on during my internship was building a high-accuracy speech-to-text model. This model was designed to convert spoken language into written text with a high degree of accuracy. This technology is especially useful in applications like voice assistants, transcription services, and more. I also worked on a project that focused on noise reduction, which involved developing techniques to minimize background noise in audio recordings. This was particularly challenging, as it required a deep understanding of audio processing and machine learning algorithms. Another project I contributed to was the development of a voice activity detection system, which can detect and isolate voice activity in audio streams. This is useful in various applications, including telecommunication and surveillance.

One of the most exciting projects I worked on during my internship was the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks. LLMs are advanced computer models that can understand and generate human language. They are used in a wide range of applications, from chatbots to content generation. Fine-tuning these models to perform specific tasks required a lot of experimentation and careful adjustment of the model's parameters.

Perhaps the project that I am most proud of is the development of a wildlife detection system. This system was designed to identify different species of animals using machine learning techniques. It was a challenging project, but it was also very rewarding because it demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and I significantly improved my programming skills in Python.

In addition to my machine learning projects, I have also developed strong skills in database management. I have experience working with both relational databases like MySQL and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. This knowledge has been crucial in developing efficient and scalable applications that can handle large amounts of data. On the frontend side, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, which are essential for creating user-friendly and responsive web interfaces. For backend development, I have experience using Node.js and Express.js, which are powerful tools for building server-side applications.

To manage my projects and collaborate with others, I use various development tools like Eclipse, VS Code, and GitHub. These tools help me write, debug, and share code efficiently. They are also essential for version control, which is crucial when working on large projects or in a team.

Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I have many hobbies that are very important to me and play a big role in keeping me balanced and happy.

Music and Solitude: One of my favorite hobbies is listening to music. Music has always been a big part of my life. It’s my escape from the stress and busyness of everyday life. I enjoy a wide range of music genres, and I often find myself getting lost in the melodies and rhythms. When I put on my headphones and immerse myself in music, it feels like the world around me fades away, leaving me in a peaceful and relaxed state of mind. I prefer spending time alone when I listen to music because it gives me the space to reflect and recharge. Being alone allows me to clear my mind and think deeply about my goals, dreams, and the challenges I face. It’s during these moments of solitude that I find my inner peace and regain my energy to keep moving forward.

Traveling Alone: Another hobby that I am passionate about is traveling alone. While some people enjoy traveling with friends or family, I find that traveling alone gives me a sense of freedom and independence. It allows me to explore new places at my own pace and on my own terms. Whether it’s a short trip to a nearby town or a longer journey to a distant city, I enjoy the adventure and the opportunity to discover new cultures, foods, and landscapes. Traveling alone also gives me time to reflect and learn more about myself. It helps me build confidence and self-reliance, as I navigate new environments and meet new people along the way. Each trip is a learning experience, and I come back from every journey with new insights and a renewed sense of purpose.

Worshipping God: Another deeply important aspect of my life is my spiritual practice. Worshipping God is not just a ritual for me; it’s a way of life. I find immense peace and solace in prayer and meditation. Taking time out of my day to connect with God helps me stay grounded and centered, no matter how hectic life gets. Whether I’m visiting a temple, offering prayers at home, or simply sitting in quiet reflection, these moments of devotion give me strength and clarity. They remind me of the larger purpose of life and keep me focused on my values and goals. My faith is a source of inner strength, guiding me through challenges and helping me maintain a positive outlook on life. Worshipping God also instills in me a sense of gratitude, reminding me to appreciate all the blessings in my life and to approach each day with humility and kindness.

In my personal life, I enjoy spending time alone. I find peace in solitude, where I can reflect on my thoughts and recharge my energy. I love listening to music, which helps me relax and escape from the stresses of daily life. Traveling alone is another passion of mine, as it allows me to explore new places, meet new people, and experience different cultures. Additionally, I enjoy playing volleyball, a sport that keeps me physically active and teaches me the importance of teamwork and strategy.

At this point in my life, I am very excited about the opportunity to work at Genpact. I believe that my strong foundation in software development, my experience in machine learning, and my eagerness to learn and grow make me a good fit for your team. I am looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and I am eager to contribute to your projects with my skills and passion for technology.
